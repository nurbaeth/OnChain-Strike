🎮 Game Concept      
OnChain Strike is a turn-based, tactical simulation of a 5v5 shooter game — entirely on the blockchain.      
Players join as Terrorists or Counter-Terrorists, perform actions like:      
  
🔫 Shoot opponents
    
🚶 Move across zones (planned) 

💣 Plant/defuse a bomb (in progress)   
  
🎯 Eliminate the enemy team  
    
🧠 Make smart decisions, because everything is on-chain

No off-chain servers. No backend. 100% smart contract logic.
